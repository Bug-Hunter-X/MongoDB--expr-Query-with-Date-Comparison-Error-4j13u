```javascript
const query = { "$expr": { "$gt": ["$date", ISODate("2023-10-26T12:00:00Z")] }};
//This query will return an error if the date field is not of type Date.
//Also, it is important to ensure that the date format is correct.
//In addition, it is important to check that the index on the date field is present

//The correct query is:
const query = { "$expr": { "$gt": [{ $toDate: "$date" }, ISODate("2023-10-26T12:00:00Z")] }};
```
